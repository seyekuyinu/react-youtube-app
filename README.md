# ReactAppWithYouTubeAPI

I put this together learning React and trying to use the YouTube search API.

### Getting Started

There are two methods for getting started with this repo.

#### To Use this with Git?
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/seyekuyinu/react-youtube-app.git
> cd ReactYouTubeApp
> npm install
> npm start
```

#### Not Familiar with Git?
Click [here](https://github.com/seyekuyinu/react-youtube-app/archive/master.zip) to download the .zip file.  Extract the contents of the zip file, then open your terminal, change to the project directory, and:

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
